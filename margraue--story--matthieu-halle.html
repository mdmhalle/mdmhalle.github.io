     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a time books full of information were available everywhere. Every home contained at least one book perhaps more. Books were as plentiful as children are today and were discarded just as carelessly.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;Margraue wore an expression of absolute disdain as he squirmed about unable to find a comfortable sitting position. It was clear that he wanted to be anywhere but there amidst a group of expectant children all filled with reverence, silent with suppressed excitement and eager to hear again the story Margraue had deigned to read aloud with his sigh laden voice. Margraue saw that he would have to go through with it because the children's committee had once again made it a regular schedule day. How would he get through the next seventy-five minutes let alone the next week. How could it only be Monday morning. Margraue hated school. Still he tried to delay the inevitable, &quot;May I go to the washroom?&quot;</p>
     <p>&quot;You've just had a locker break&quot; came the forceful reply from the children. &quot;You should have gone when you had the chance, now get down to business.&quot;</p>
     <p>&quot;But you let Mr. Mickle out last class, he told me so himself.&quot;</p>
     <p>&quot;That was because he needed to take some of his prescription&quot;. Hemmed in at every turn by the unyielding system Margraue showed his disdain by rolling his eyes around in his head and pursing his lips far all to hear. The children knew by this gesture that he would submit. Margraue began to read, &quot;Once upon a time books full of information ...&quot;</p>
     <p>&quot;Louder please.&quot; The children chorused. &quot;And not so fast it isn't a race.&quot;</p>
     <p>&quot;WERE AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE.&quot; Margraue raised his head from the book in front of him as he finished the sentence. He could see that the children ignored his insolence. He read on, properly this time. &quot;Every home contained at least one book perhaps more.&quot; Who wrote this rubbish thought Margraue. He never failed to laugh immanely as he saw the look of awe on the faces of the children. If only he could be playing adult version Lynthon Lythakia right now.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&quot;Books were as plentiful as computer chips and were discarded as carelessly.&quot;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;Margraue cursed the day that the asteroid had destroyed the permanent save stocks of the World Information Resource Centre. The fools had centralized themselves into a corner and only information bandits like himself had been thoughtful enough or foolhardy enough to develop their memory. There were no books anywhere -that was considered too risky or too dangerous. No the big picture was kept under lock and key and info was fed out to the masses one spoonful at a time.&nbsp; He actually knew how to read and he knew many, many things and now he was no worse than an information serf. He played nursemaid to a group of snot nosed Junior information overlords.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&quot;It is said that teachers were overabundant and students saw school as prison and learning as a terrible burden imposed upon them by an unfeeling system&quot; The children always expressed shock at this part, thought Margraue, some were even outraged. He knew how those students of the before time felt - mass produced assembly line standardized test approved benchmark garbage. He spat, <span id="u331-23">phew</span>. He had forgotten where he was. He looked up to see the group looking at him sternly. &quot;We will not accept spitting in the classroom,&quot; they intoned. &quot;You will be sent to the office immediately. After school you will report to this classroom for a detention come with a lesson plan and be prepared to teach a seventy-minute lesson.&quot; They didn't miss a beat. He was being beaten into submission by good old 'behaviourist' cudgel.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Margraue was a prisoner enlisted to teach the Information Overlords. He'd show them a thing or two. Asteroid 367 shattered the complacency of this age as the information core melted down. The Overlords panicked and rounded up people like Margraue who had received information training in the old way in rebel outposts.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Chastened Margraue behaved through the remaining classes. When 3:10 arrived he fully expected to report for his detention ready to drone on about aesopic Fables. Something woke inside him however and instead he caught the 3:15 bus and went home. Next day he was called into the Principal's Office. He let out a gargantuan '<span id="u331-31">PAWP</span>' as he burst out of the central office. He had actually received a 3 day suspension.</p>
